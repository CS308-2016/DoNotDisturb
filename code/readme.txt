Project Description 
------------------- 

“Do not disturb” is a smart sound device. The goal of this device is to alter the behaviour of a music system by receiving feedback from the surroundings about human voice and conversation. 

It provides users independence from needing to reduce the volume of music while speaking, and to avoid them to bring the volume back when the conversation ends. It becomes the device’s role to notice that there is human conversation and to accordingly change the volume of the music system. An analogous application and implementation of this device, is to change the radio frequency when the RJ is speaking and find a channel where there is music playing.
